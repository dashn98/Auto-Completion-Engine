Approach to User_History
My approach is to read in each line from the user's history if there is a user history text file.
Each line is added to a history arrayList.
Each time a new letter is entered by the user. prior to printing out suggestions the program loops through the user history arrayList
searching for any words the user previously entered that match the prefix that is entered and adds them to a suggestion arrayList
Next if there are less than five history suggestions it will fill in the rest of suggestions based on the dictionary findWord method.



Data Structures from the java standard library:
I used the ArrayList data structure which has an runtime that is O(1)
